You are fixing failures from Neural Junkie **layer gate: collab-full**.
Layer goal: Full collab-scenarios sweep (~15 scenarios, 1–3h)
Do not weaken assertions. Fix product/hub/agent behavior first (docs/TESTING.md).
After edits, run the targeted verification commands in this brief.

---


Rules (mandatory):
- Triage product/hub/agent behavior first, harness second (docs/TESTING.md).
- Do NOT weaken test assertions or scenario contracts to greenwash flakes.
- Prefer minimal, focused fixes in the neural-junkie repo.
- After edits, run the targeted verification commands listed below.
- Summarize what you changed and which commands you ran.
